= Spring Shell 2

Spring Shell 2 is an ongoing effort to completely rewrite
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-shell[Spring Shell] from scratch, making it more modular
while maintaining some level of backward compatibility with your existing commands.

== Building
```
./mvnw package
```

== Running
The project comes with a sample application, showcasing the various ways you can write commands.

```
./mvnw install
./mvnw -pl spring-shell-samples spring-boot:run
```

From there, try typing `help` or `help <commmand>` at the shell prompt.
