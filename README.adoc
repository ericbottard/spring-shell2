= Spring Shell 2

Spring Shell 2 is an ongoing effort to completely rewrite
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-shell[Spring Shell] from scratch, making it more modular
while maintaining some level of backward compatibility with your existing commands.

== Building
```
./mvnw package
```

== Running
*Note:* the dummy commands that are currently available are not here to stay. Expect a more modular
setup in the future. In the meantime, to get a grasp of how the shell would behave, you can
```
# if using a local snapshot version
./mvnw install
./mvnw -pl spring-shell2-samples spring-boot:run
```

From there, try typing `help` at the shell prompt.
